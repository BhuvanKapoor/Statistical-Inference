## Introduction
This repository is designed to help you grasp key concepts related to estimating population parameters based on sample data, confidence intervals, simulation techniques, and unbiased and maximum likelihood estimators!

## Content
The repository includes the following components:

- **Confidence Intervals: Capturing the Unknown with Certainty (almost)**
Imagine trying to guess the average height of all giraffes without measuring them all.  Confidence intervals (CIs) come to the rescue! They provide a range of values where the true population parameter is likely to reside, with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%) .

  - Large Samples: For large samples (n > 30), we can leverage the Central Limit Theorem, which allows us to use the normal distribution to construct CIs. Think of it as a bell curve  where the most likely values cluster around the center and less probable values lie further away.

  - Small Samples: When dealing with smaller samples (n < 30), things get a bit trickier. We might need to rely on other distributions like the t-distribution, which has "fatter tails" than the normal distribution, accounting for the increased uncertainty with fewer data points .

- **Simulation: Bringing Statistics to Life**
Simulating data allows us to explore statistical concepts in a hands-on way. Imagine creating a virtual world where you flip coins, roll dice, or draw samples from different distributions ️. By repeating these simulations, we can gain valuable insights into how statistics behave in different scenarios.

  - Unbiased Estimators: An unbiased estimator, like the sample mean, aims to hit the bullseye of the true population parameter on average, even if individual estimates might be off-target sometimes . We can use simulations to assess the bias of different estimators and compare their performance.

  - Maximum Likelihood Estimators: These estimators aim to maximize the likelihood of observing the data we actually have, like finding the hat that best fits the rabbit pulled from the magician's hat . Simulations can help us evaluate how well they track the true parameter as sample size changes.
